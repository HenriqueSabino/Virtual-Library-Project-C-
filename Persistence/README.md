# Persistence Layer

This module is responsible for encapsulating all the details of data persistence for the virtual library system. It includes the Entity Framework Core `DbContext`, entity configurations, and any required migrations to build and maintain the database schema.

The `DbContext` serves as the primary class that coordinates Entity Framework functionality for the data model. Entity configurations are used to configure EF Core behavior for specific entities and their relationships. Migrations contain the necessary commands to incrementally update the database schema to keep it in sync with the entity models.
