        }

        // Here you will add all the CRUD operations for Administrators, which will use the IAdministratorService
        // Below is an example of how one might look for retrieving an administrator's details:

        [HttpGet("{id}")]
        public IActionResult GetAdministratorById(int id)
        {
            var administrator = _administratorService.GetAdministratorById(id);
            if (administrator == null)
                return NotFound();
            
            return Ok(administrator);
        }

        // Additional actions (POST, PUT, DELETE) will be added here following your application requirements
    }
}
```
Please note that the included example is an oversimplified version of what an action might look like in the `AdministratorsController`. In a real project, you would need to handle various other concerns such as input validation, mapping between DTOs and view models, error handling, and following security best practices.
