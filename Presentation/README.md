# Virtual Library Presentation Module

The Presentation module is responsible for handling all the application's user interfaces and API endpoints. This module interacts with the Application module to process requests and return responses to clients.

## Structure
- `Controllers`: This directory contains all the API controllers that handle client requests, such as HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- `ViewModels`: Contains all view models which represent the data that the API will send to the clients or receive from them.

## Controllers
Controllers are responsible for receiving input from users, invoking the corresponding application services, and returning the appropriate results.

## ViewModels
ViewModels are used to shape the data the API will work with. They are the data contracts for the API, determining what data is expected from requests and what data will be provided in responses.

## Usage
This module's services should be consumed by any user interfaces and can be used to integrate with third-party systems, providing a clear separation between the system's core functionalities and how users or systems interact with those functionalities.
