# Application Module

## Overview
The Application module is the service layer of our Virtual Library System. It is responsible for orchestrating the core business logic and providing a higher level of abstraction to the Presentation layer. It acts as an intermediary between the UI and the domain logic encapsulated in the Core module.

## Responsibilities
- Implementing interfaces defined in the Core module.
- Data transfer between Core's domain entities and Presentation layer.
- Application of business rules on top of domain logic.
- Transformation of domain entities to Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).
- Validating and preparing data for the Persistence module.

## Structure
- DTOs: Objects that carry data between processes in order to reduce the number of method calls.
- Interfaces: Defines the contracts for services that are to be implemented.
- Mappings: Configurations for mapping between domain entities and DTOs.
- Services: Classes that implement application logic and transactions.

## Usage
All operations that are exposed to the Presentation layer must go through services defined in this module.

Make sure to use dependency injection to connect interfaces to their implementations, ensuring low coupling and high modularity in the system.

## Best Practices
- Keep services thin, with business logic living in domain entities or domain services.
- Follow SOLID principles to make services maintainable and extensible.

## Notes
This module should not have any dependency on the Presentation or Infrastructure modules to ensure a clean separation of concerns.
